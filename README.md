# react-webpack-babel
Simple React Webpack Babel Starter Kit


This is a simple [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) and [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) application with nothing else in it.

### What's in it?

Just a simple [index.jsx](./index.jsx), [webpack.config.js](./webpack.config.js) and [index.html](./public/index.html) file.

### To run

* You'll need to have [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed in your system.
* Fork and clone the project:

```
> $ git clone https://github.com/alicoding/react-webpack-babel.git
```

Then install the dependencies:

```
> $ npm install
```

Install webpack and the development server:

```
> $ npm i webpack-dev-server webpack -g
```

You can simply run webpack build using this command:

```
> $ npm run build
```

If you want to run with webpack-dev-server simply run this command:

```
> $ npm run dev
```

Open the web browser to `http://localhost:8888/`

Please contribute to the project if you think this can be done better in anyway even for this README :)
